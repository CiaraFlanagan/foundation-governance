# List of ideas to recruit more diverse contributors

Goal: We would like to have a membership that represents the diversity of humans using and driving InnerSource. This includes diversity in (add angles here)

## Current tensions:

The InnerSource Commons Foundation is a membership driven foundation. As such everyone, who is using InnerSource inside of the organisation - but in particular those acting as InnerSource champions (link to pattern missing) - is invited to participate in our working groups and improve any material they use on a daily basis but find needs improvement - be it patterns, the learning path or translations of either.

Participation in working groups means being ahead of the curve in terms of industry standards when it comes to solving challenges with InnerSource methods. It also means external validation and for free improvment of any approaches to internal challenges found. Working groups are structured such that consistent participation will turn contributors into working group Trusted Committers - much like showing committment to an InnerSource project makes people highly likely candidates for Trusted Committership in those projects.

Foundation members are recruited from these working group Trusted Committers. We are looking for members who would like to help run the foundation behind the movement and increase activity after being voted in as a member by existing members.

The InnerSource Commons Foundation is a membership run foundation - board members are nominated (in general) out of the pool of existing foundation members and voted on by existing members. Membership in the foundation is tied to the individual, not to whoever the individual happens to be affiliated with.

To move the foundation forward we need a basis of active members, who are committed to moving InnerSource itself but also the foundation forward. For that we need to find individuals who find time to invest here. This can be personal time - but more likely than not it should also be paid time, in particular if they are active on the topic as researchers, practitioners or change makers.
