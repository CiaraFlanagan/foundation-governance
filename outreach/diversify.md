# List of ideas to recruit more diverse contributors

Goal: We would like to have a membership that represents the diversity of humans using and driving InnerSource. This includes diversity in (add angles here)

## Current tensions:

The InnerSource Commons Foundation is a membership driven foundation. As such everyone, who is using InnerSource inside of the organisation - but in particular those acting as InnerSource champions (link to pattern missing) - is invited to participate in our working groups and improve any material they use on a daily basis but find needs improvement - be it patterns, the learning path or translations of either.

Participation in working groups means being ahead of the curve in terms of industry standards when it comes to solving challenges with InnerSource methods. It also means external validation and for free improvment of any approaches to internal challenges found. Working groups are structured such that consistent participation will turn contributors into working group Trusted Committers - much like showing committment to an InnerSource project makes people highly likely candidates for Trusted Committership in those projects.

Foundation members are recruited from these working group Trusted Committers. We are looking for members who would like to help run the foundation behind the movement and increase activity after being voted in as a member by existing members.

The InnerSource Commons Foundation is a membership run foundation - board members are nominated (in general) out of the pool of existing foundation members and voted on by existing members. Membership in the foundation is tied to the individual, not to whoever the individual happens to be affiliated with.

To move the foundation forward we need a basis of active members, who are committed to moving InnerSource itself but also the foundation forward. For that we need to find individuals who find time to invest here. This can be personal time - but more likely than not it should also be paid time, in particular if they are active on the topic as researchers, practitioners or change makers.

## Potential actions:

* Communicate benefits of being involved in our working groups, e.g.:
   * Sharing material through ISC means additional external validation and review. Often given a specific challenge this means others provide additional options to solve the challenge or discover side effects seen in other organisations that were not obvious from the start.
   * Collaborating on learning path modules here as opposed to inside of an organisation means sharing the cost and time invest to create these modules. In addition it means getting additional external inspiration on aspects to cover and ways to explain concepts.
   * Participation in learning material creation means harmonizing training material - so instead of going through a time costly onboarding series inside of any specific org, new employees who have been working with InnerSource before already know the basics - and those basics match the industry standard. Participation here means being able to influence that industry standard.
   * Active participation at the ISC shows committment to the topic as an employer, it also show leadership in the field for any consulting businesses.
* Semi-formal mentorship programs can help Juniors at the beginning of their InnerSource journey become productive inside of the InnerSource commons more quickly.
* How-To sessions on how to contribute and why can highlight contributions we value - this could be a community call.
