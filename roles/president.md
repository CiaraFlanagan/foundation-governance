## List of accountabilities of the president role

The InnerSource Commons Foundation exists to provide a home to InnerSource practioners to collaborate on developing InnerSource best practices on a neutral ground across organisation boundaries.

Actual work is done in our working groups, like the learning path working group, the marketing working group as well as the patterns working group.

While a lot of our work can be and is based on volunteer contributions (though often backed by employers supporting their InnerSource champions by giving them time to participate here), some of the work to keep the foundation up and running needs a level of consistency and timely responses that we do not want to expect from volunteers - as a result some of the operational work is supported by paid support.

Oversight over our working groups is with the board of directors. It is also them who elect a (volunteer, not paid for by the foundation) president who then provides oversight of the daily operations of the foundation and regularly reports progress to the board of directors. Topics related to operations include but are not limited to:

* Sponsorship
* Event management
* Formal outreach and initiation of collaboration with related organisations in the industry (ideally each collaboration SHOULD be represented in the organisation by a separate "hat" (read: title/role) in the org though)
* (add missing tasks)
