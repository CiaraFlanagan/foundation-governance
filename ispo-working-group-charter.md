# ISPO Working Group Charter

This working group aims to provide materials to InnerSource Program Offices (ISPOs) to help them establish themselves, teach InnerSource, and scale. Senior leaders, managers, or individuals in various roles can benefit from this material.  

## Summary

The majority of training and teaching content can be shared across companies when the contexts are similar.  

While not every company in InnerSource is the same, not every company is different. For each challenge in InnerSource, a few standard solutions may work for most.  

We document standard solutions to challenges, make them discoverable, and provide open source implementations of these solutions.  

Documents, videos, or code will likely be implemented, each generic yet specific enough to be used across companies without requiring significant company-specific work to solve problems.  

## Examples

The working group could introduce video clips to explain InnerSource's various benefits from a Senior Leader's perspective, for example, to answer the question:  

*How do I sell InnerSource to Senior Leadership?*  

IPSOs could curate InnerSource videos that benefit their Senior Leaders.  

Taking the challenge:

*How do I present InnerSource KPIs?*  

Our group could create a software project to generate InnerSource activity charts from GitHub and Jira. Depending on GitHub and Jira report configurations, a project could be preconfigured in limited ways.  

ISPOs can use these examples to advance their missions by providing directly-useable materials that fill business needs.  

## Implementation

Workgroup members will discover, produce, and spread InnerSource solutions.  

This production will be tracked on a Kanban board as follows:

1. **Challenge** — We've identified a problem as a challenge.
1. **Proposed** — An article, coding up a tool, a training video, etc., that could meet the challenge.
1. **Internal** — The solution has been implemented internally.
1. **External** — The solution is externally available.
1. **Validated** — Solution used by more than one company.

We will list new challenges weekly, discuss proposed solutions, and demo effective solutions.  

It is expected that many solutions will be implemented by other InnerSource Commons working groups (e.g., Patterns, Learning Path)
