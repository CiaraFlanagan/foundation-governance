# How to Create a Private Slack Channel

In our open, inviting, and contributing community, we expect most Slack channels to be public.
Private Slack channels may be useful when discussing specific details on our connection with specific people or organizations.

If you feel that you need a private Slack channel, request it in the [#members](https://app.slack.com/client/T04PXKRM0/G0134RBUXHP) channel with a brief description of what you want to do.
This approach gives the request visibility and allows anyone with thoughts to chime in.
If the request and conversation sounds reasonable to a Slack admin, then they can create the channel for you.
