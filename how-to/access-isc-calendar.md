The InnerSource Commons Foundation has a Google calendar that members can use to schedule events in the InnerSource Commons.
If you want to use the calendar, then you can request access from [@Lenucksi] for your Google account.
After you have access, the InnerSource Commons Calendar should show up in your list of available calendars in the Google Calendar UI.
