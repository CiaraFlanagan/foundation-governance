The InnerSource Commons Foundation has a [Google calendar] that people can use to view and schedule events in the InnerSource Commons.
If you want to use the calendar, then you can request access from [@Andrea Kyurchiev] for your Google account.
After you have access, the InnerSource Commons Public Calendar should show up in your list of available calendars in the Google Calendar UI.
