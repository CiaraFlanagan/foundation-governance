The InnerSource Commons Foundation has a [Google calendar] that people can use to view and schedule events in the InnerSource Commons.
If you want to use the calendar, then you can request access by posting a message in the [#google-admins] Slack channel.
The InnerSource Commons Public Calendar is for public events.
The InnerSource Commons Private Calendar is for private events and should only be used by Foundation members.
We expect that most events in the InnerSource Commons will be public.

When creating events, be sure that your title is clear to anyone that reads it and doesn't contain some special jargon that is only understandable to people that are already in your group.
