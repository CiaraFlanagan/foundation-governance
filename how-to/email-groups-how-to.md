# Creating a Google Group/Group Email address in the InnerSource Commons domain

This document describes how to create and interact with Google Groups/Email Groups in the InnerSource Commons domain.

* Decide on an email address for the group ex: info@innersourcecommons.org
* Make a list of the people that want to manage and be responsible for emails in the group with you.
* Creating a Google Group is reserved for the Google Workspace Admins and therefore you should contact  Andrea Kyurchiev (or Russ Rutledge if AK is unavailable) on Slack
* You can see the groups you're a part of by going to [Google Groups]
