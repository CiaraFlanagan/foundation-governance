# How to Bill the Foundation

If you have contracted to do work for (or need to be reimbursed by) the foundation,
then here is how you get paid.

1. Send an original, itemized invoice by email to the Executive Director.
2. Executive Director reviews.
If approved, the Executive Director forwards the itemized invoice to the Treasurer.
3. Treasurer pays the invoice within 30 days of receiving it.
