This document describes some part of how to create a working group in the InnerSource Commons.

* Make a folder with the name of your working group in the [InnerSource Commons GDrive].
* Copy and complete a [project template] document.
* Find people that want to work on the project with you.
* Hold a kickoff meeting to go over the completed project document.
* Create a _Slack_ channel with the name of your working group.
* Invite all interested into your _Slack_ channel.
* Ask [Andrea Kyurchiev] for help to list your group on https://innersourcecommons.org/community/.
* Schedule any virtual meetings using the [InnerSource Commons calendar] for invites and https://meet.jit.si/ for video.
